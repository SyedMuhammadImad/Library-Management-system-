# AVL library management console system

experimental console project. Compile `main.cpp` with a C++17 compiler and run it. The menu implements the operations shown in the source. Invalid menu input and end-of-input are handled without looping forever.

```sh
g++ -std=c++17 -Wall -Wextra -pedantic main.cpp -o app
./app
```
